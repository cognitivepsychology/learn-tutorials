  Most graphs have two axes, referred to often as the $x$ axis and the $y$ axis. We use a graph to understand the relationship between these two variables. A three
  -dimensional
  graph lets you introduce a third axis, typically called the $z$ axis, and can help you understand the relationship between three variables.
  Three-dimensional
  scatter plots are best when you have at least three features that you want to highlight in your graph. Using color and size you can highlight two additional features in your graph. Plotly’s interactive tools also let you explore your plot by zooming, hovering, and rotating your plot.

  For this tutorial, we’re
  using the “Prestige”
  dataset
  from R’s
  “car” package
  . The data set contains information about status (quantified with the Pineo-Porter index), salary, years of schooling, and gender for job categories in the 1970s. You can learn more
