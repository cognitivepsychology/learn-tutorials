  High five! You’ve created a second y-axis (on the right), but all three of the data traces still scale with the first y-axis (on the left). What gives? This is because all three traces are still assigned to the first y-axis. You need to assign a trace to the new y-axis in order for its data to scale with it - the steps below show you how.

  If you’re reading this, you probably know that the range of each of your x and y axes can be precisely adjusted in the
  AXES
  popover. It is often faster and easier, however, to adjust the axes range visually by clicking-and-dragging the corners of your graph. See the screenshots below for a preview of how to do this.
