  When you embed a Plotly graph, it means you’re sharing your graph, data and the code that describes your graph all in one place. With our interactive features, your readers have a whole new way to engage with your work. When you update your Plotly graph, the graph automatically updates on your blog or website. No need for manual updates! Streaming data is also supported in embedded graphs. Learn more about how to interface Plotly with your favorite hardware in the

  The best way to embed a Plotly graph is with
  iFrames
  .  You’ll just need to paste a snippet of HTML code into your webpage or blog.  In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to get the right code.  We’ve included tips on how to place the code in your website in
  Step 2
  below.  Finally, if you’re using wordpress.com, jump to the explanation below. Wordpress doesn’t support iFrames, but we’ve come up with a workaround for you.

  There are two places to locate the embed code in Plotly.  If you want to share someone else’s graph, Option 1, is the easier choice.  If you’re in your workspace, then you’ll want to check out Option 2.

  Wordpress.com doesn’t support iFrames. Here’s how you can download an image of your graph to embed in your Wordpress site. The image is static, but you can link back to your interactive graph hosted at Plotly. If you’re hosting your own site and using wordpress.org, there are a few options for plugins that will help you with iFrames.
