                    be public or private. To share your graph on a public site,
                    you’ll need to make sure you select

  To print a Plotly graph, we recommend you
    save the graph to your computer, and then print. If you want to print
    someone else’s graph, you can “fork and edit” the graph
    into your own workspace.
