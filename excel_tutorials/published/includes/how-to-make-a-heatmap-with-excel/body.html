       For this particular data, we also want to center our gradient so that yellow correlates to a value of 60.2, and everything above or below is a little red or green. The easiest way to do this is by nudging the “Z range” values in the “Range/bins” tab to converge on our desired midpoint  -- we compressed our range, but you can also stretch it if you prefer the effect.
