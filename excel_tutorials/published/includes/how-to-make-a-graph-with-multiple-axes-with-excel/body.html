   High five! You’ve created a second y-axis (on the right), but all three of the data traces still scale with the first y-axis (on the left). What gives? This is because all three traces are still assigned to the first y-axis. You need to assign a trace to the new y-axis in order for its data to scale with it - the steps below show you how.
