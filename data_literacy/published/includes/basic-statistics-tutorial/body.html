        and maximum values, mean, median, quartiles, standard deviation,
        variance and standard error. The data in this tutorial comes

   Plotly has both descriptive and
        inferential statistical tools. For our example we’re interested
        in quantitative features to describe our data set. This is exactly
        what
   descriptive statistics
   does.
   On the other
        hand, if you want to use a sample data set to make predictions about a
        larger population,
   inferential
        statistics
   is the tool you’ll want
        to use.

       Some insights: the
                        average (mean) age of a Nobel Prize winner is almost 56
                        years
       old.
       Half of all
                        Nobel Prize winners were between the ages of 47 and 64
                        when they received the prize (Q1 and Q3).  The
                        youngest winner (min) -- Lawrence Bragg -- was 25 years
                        old.
